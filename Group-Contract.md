#AdventureXP

 ##Group contract: 

Members:

Jonathan Finner Smith,

Mark Patrick Brian Petersen,

Rasmus Jessen,

Nikolai Aamand

Every member needs to take the project seriously and participate as much as possible, the perfect outcome would be that each member contributes just as much as everybody else. We plan to meet at the school everyday unless another location is planned, the specific time to meet is planned at the end of the day before. 

If one of the members is not able to come and participate in the project it needs to be said the night before unless it is an emergency. The place where to contact the rest of the team is in our messenger thread. 

If a member is not able to meet in school but can work online the entire team needs to figure out what each specific member needs to work on. 
If a member is repeatedly absent and does not inform the group the rest of the group will have a meeting on what to do. 
We will use trunk based branching for the project, which means there are no feature branches but two main branches which handle frontend and backend.

hvis man laver en ny metode, funktion, test eller klasse skal der gives et klart og tydeligt navn som er idiotsikkert
